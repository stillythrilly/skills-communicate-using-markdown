| Type of Prerequisite | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Mandatory | State of your product:<br><br><ul><li>Products that are already productive (GA) or</li><li>New products with an experienced Program Lead.</li></ul> |
| Mandatory | Your development team adheres to a **feature-driven development approach**, thereby practicing feature-based release decisions (i.e., deployment has been decoupled from release decisions):<br><br><ul><li>Your development team focuses on developing individual features (or functionality) of the software rather than focusing on the *software as a whole*.</li><li>Also, your team practices continuous delivery, using feature toggles.</li><li>Alternatively, a synchronized deployment of features based on the latest artifact (which is checked for compliance by pipelines) is also allowed.  <br>    For example, a release decision meeting could be conducted every two weeks, during which the decision is made to release a bunch of features together.</li></ul> |
| Mandatory | Integration with backlog tool:<br><br><ul><li>As backlog tool, any Jira is supported and can be connected to your product in Hyperspace's Compliance Management. This is particularly relevant for all requirements that need compliance checks at the feature level, as these checks are carried out using the backlog tool.</li><li>To map features to their requirements in your backlog tool, you **must** use issue type *Feature* in Jira.</li><li>If you are using a Jira instance other than SAP Jira, please [contact us] so that we can configure the connection.</li></ul> |
| Mandatory | Compliance on artifact level must be checked using pipelines:<br><br><ul><li>Any CI/CD setup is supported. A team can either use the Hyperspace offering or their own pipelines. However, we **strongly recommend** that you use **Typetest**. </li><li>Your pipelines have been integrated in Sirius via Cumulus.</li></ul> |
| Mandatory | Your product must be a “simple” product. This means, it should contain only one software component version (SCV). This SCV must not be comprised in an on-Premise product version (PV).<br><br>For example, in **Marktest**, you would make sure that:<br><br><ul><li>Your product would only have a single product version (PV) 1.0.</li><li>Your software component (SC) would only have a single software component version 1.0.</li><li>Multiple subsequent product versions and software component versions, like 2311, 2402, 2405, would not be permitted.</li></ul> |
